# Papers

List of useful papers.

## Comp Arch

- [Gem5](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tushar/papers/pdfs/gem5_can2011.pdf)
  - This paper discusses the architecture of the gem5 simulator
  - Reading it helps one to understand the codebase much better

## CXL

- [PIM Is All You Need: A CXL-Enabled GPU-Free System for Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07578)
  - Proposes a CXL switch multicast technique
  - The purpose was to replicate the embedding vectors, but it could be adopted to support replication

## Simulation

- [Phantora: Live GPU Cluster Simulation for Machine Learning System Performance Estimation](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.01616v1)
  - Proposes live simulation method, requires synchronization
  - The concept can be extended: extract perf counters and enforce explicit synchronization
- [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/)
  - Network simulator.
